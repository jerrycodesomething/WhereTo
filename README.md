## Introduction
WhereTo is a native Android app developed in fulfilment of the course requirements for WIX3004 Mobile Application Development. An Android social search and discovery app based on local check-in trends. Users can find friends on the platform and share their favourite hangout spots. Not only that, but users can also check out trending locations in their local area to help answer all their "where to" questions when making plans with friends. Additionally, in light of the ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic situation, the WhereTo? app now allows users to check out the crowdedness of a place to help them make informed decisions on where to go with their health in mind.

*Disclaimer: while the app fulfils most of the proposed functional and non-functional requirements, it is still in the alpha development stage, so there are a number of major bugs that have yet to be fixed and features that have yet to be implemented.
