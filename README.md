# WhereTo?
## Introduction
WhereTo is a native Android app developed in fulfilment of the course requirements for WIX3004 Mobile Application Development. An Android social search and discovery app based on local check-in trends. Users can find friends on the platform and share their favourite hangout spots. Not only that, but users can also check out trending locations in their local area to help answer all their "where to" questions when making plans with friends. Additionally, in light of the ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic situation, the WhereTo? app allows users to check out the crowdedness of a place to help them make informed decisions on where to go with their health in mind.
